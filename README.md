# AutoMod Discord Bot
What does this bot do?. 
It bans or kicks new Discord accounts within certain day(s)


#### How to set it up

1) Change `.env.example` to `.env`
2) Fill out all of the fields in that `.env` file.
3) Run `npm install` in the terminal/console 
4) Once you do all of that, open a terminal and use `node ./src/index.js`

### No support 
We don't offer selfhosting for this bot, it was made to stop troll accounts from joining and annoying the piss out of server admins & mods.
